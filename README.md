# Building

You should have already installed GLFW on your system. If it is in a nonstandard location, you may have to edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Compilation is as usual for CMake projects:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Now the executable `learnOpenGL` should get created in the `build` directory.
